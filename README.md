Prime Number Finder

Prime Number Finder is a simple Python project that allows users to find all prime numbers within a given input range. Prime numbers are integers greater than 1 that are divisible only by 1 and themselves. This program efficiently identifies primes by iterating over a user-specified range and checking each number's primality.
